			QuickDesign Privacy Policy
		</div>
			<p>
				Sun Hydraulics, LLC (“Sun Hydraulics”) values your privacy, and we are committed to
				maintaining the highest level of confidentiality with all the registration information we receive.
				This Privacy Policy describes our data collection, use, and sharing practices.
			</p>
			<p>
				References in this Privacy Policy to “you,” or “your” means you, the individual user browsing
				and accessing http://quickdesign.sunhydraulics.com/default.aspx (the “Site”). Where we refer to
				“us,” “we,” or “our,” this means Sun Hydraulics, LLC.
			</p>

			<div class="header">
		What Kind of Information Does Sun Hydraulics Collect?
			</div>
			<p>
				When you complete the registration information in order to use the QuickDesign Site, we collect
				your name, email address, and the ship-to address (the “Registration Information”), which will
				be used to link you to that geographic area’s Sun Authorized Distributors. As part of the
				registration process, you will create login information for accessing the Site on future occasions.
				A copy of your registration information and all subsequent activity on the QuickDesign Site will
				be shared with such Sun Authorized Distributors. A custom number is generated for your project
				in connection with your registration (the “Project Number”).
			</p>
		<p>
			Sun and the QuickDesign software will send you e-mail communications when appropriate
			pertaining to your projects. Sun may also contact you for trouble shooting purposes.
			When browsing or accessing the Site, we collect browsing information from you, such as your
			device type, internet browser name, web history, country location, internet service provider, and
			operating system type (collectively, “Browsing Information”). We collect your postal code or
			country when you search for an authorized distributor from our network.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the registration process, you may choose to receive additional marketing communications
			from Sun; however, you may of course decline these marketing communications. If you choose
			to enroll to our e-newsletter, we will collect your email address. When you address an inquiry to
			receive Sun Hydraulics using one of our contact forms, we collect personal information,
			including your first name, last name, email address, phone number, company name, country,
			postal code, the subject of your inquiry, and your communication to us. This feature of the Site
			also enables you to subscribe to our e-newsletter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Further, if you upload your own specification file to QuickDesign, Sun will keep confidential the
			file uploaded under your Project Number. This information will be linked to the area Sun
			Authorized Distributor, as further explained above. If a production order is submitted and
			accepted by Sun, Sun personnel who have a “need to know” in order to fulfill your order will
			have access to your uploaded file.
		</p>
		<div class="header">
			How is Information Collected by Sun Hydraulics?
		</div>
		<p>
			As described above, Sun collects the login information that you enter during registration. By
			“login information,” we mean your email address and password. Login information is stored in
			cookies, which are files that are located on the user’s computer. If you give your browser
			permission to save your login information, the Site will always collect your Browsing
			Information. Such Information will be collected via internet cookies and an analytics tool, such
			as Google Analytics, when you visit, browse, or access the Site. Cookies are small files that are
			transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser, which enable us to
			recognize you when you return to the Site. Cookies enable us to provide you with a personalized

			us by telephone or facsimile, we will also collect your personal information to the extent required

		</p>
		<p>
			In the User Agreement, we describe how you may create “Specifications” to produce an
			integrated package, including manifolds. A feature of QuickDesign is “SmartConnect.” In using
			the Service, you will be requested to grant Sun access to your Specifications (or the work in
			process) to prevent someone else from accessing it contemporaneously with you and potentially
			overwriting your work. Sun will assign a number to your Specifications, and only authorized
			employees of Sun or your Sun authorized distributor (as described in the User Agreement) will
			be able to access your Specifications after you release them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Should you choose to utilize our QuickDesign Service, we will collect certain technical

			ratios. The information referred to in this paragraph is stored with your QuickDesignproject,
			which Sun saves for your future usage. If you wish to have your account with this project
			deleted, please submit the deletion request to SunQuickDesign@sunhydraulics.com.
